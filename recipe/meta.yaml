  summary: FCOS is a detector for efficiently predicting objects in images
  description: |
    Fully convolutional one-stage object detection (FCOS) is a framework for
    per-pixel prediction of objects in images. FCOS doesn't rely on expensive
    anchor box calculations and their hyper-parameters, which is in contrast to
    state-of-the-art object detectors like RetinaNet, YOLOv3, and Faster R-CNN.
    It includes a Python API, & scripts for command line usage.
